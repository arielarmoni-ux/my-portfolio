“Color at the Design Museum Holon” explores how we understand, perceive and interpret color and colorfulness, which are usually specific to a particular time and place, tradition and culture. The exhibition examines the ways in which colors envelop objects, are integrated into them, or become objects in their own right, as well as the process through which colors come to be identified with a group, a nation, or even an abstract idea or value.
